# Amazon Seller Central Scraper (1MMS)

This repository contains an asynchronous scraper built with Playwright. It logs
into Amazon Seller Central, collects dashboard metrics for a list of stores and
submits them to a Google Form so they can be aggregated in Google Sheets.

This is the **1MMS** (single Merchant Management System) version, which uses a
single dashboard page with a store-selection dropdown instead of navigating to
individual store URLs.

The code may be executed locally or through the included GitHub Actions
workflow.

## Features

- Collects metrics for multiple stores listed in `urls.csv`
- Uses a single dashboard page with store-selection dropdown (1MMS approach)
- Posts metrics to a configurable Google Form (12 fields)
- Supports configurable concurrency and automatic adjustments based on system load
- Produces structured logs in `output/` and rotates `app.log`
- Optionally posts progress to Google Chat using collapsible cards grouped by timestamped batches. 
- Chat messages are tagged with **(1MMS)** for easy identification
- **Enhanced Job Summary**: Sends a detailed post-run report to Google Chat including:
  - High-level stats (Throughput, Success Rate, Duration)
  - Business Volume (Total Orders, Units)
  - Resilience Metrics (Retries, Stores Retried)
  - Speed Breakdown (Avg Collection Time, p95 Latency, Bottleneck Analysis)
  - Failure Analysis (Breakdown by error type and list of failed stores)

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Playwright with Chromium browsers
- See `requirements.txt` for the full list of Python packages

## Local Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

2. Copy the example configuration and edit it with your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   # then edit config.json
   ```

   Important fields include your Seller Central login details, the target Google Form URL, and concurrency settings. The example file contains all available keys.

3. Populate `urls.csv` with the stores you want to scrape. Each row uses the following columns:
   `merchant_id,new_id,store_name,marketplace_id`.

## Running Locally

Execute the scraper from the command line:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

Logs and submission data will be saved under the `output/` directory.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/run-scraper.yml` installs dependencies,
creates a `config.json` from repository secrets and runs the scraper on a
schedule. It checks the current UK time against `UK_TARGET_HOURS` to decide
whether to proceed with a run.

Artifacts such as logs are uploaded for each run and kept for seven days.

## Configuration Reference

Key options from `config.example.json`:

See the example file for full details.

## Notes

The repository excludes `config.json`, `state.json`, and `output/` from version control. These files may contain sensitive information or large log data. Ensure you keep your credentials secure.
Timestamps recorded by the scraper default to the Europe/London timezone. Modify the `LOCAL_TIMEZONE` constant in `scraper.py` if you prefer a different local time.
